# Lab-wide pre-push distribution (OMN-16991) -- sourced helper library
# =============================================================================
# Sourced by scripts/hooks/prepush_smart_tests.sh. Adds three things the hook
# has never had:
#
#   1. A host TABLE replacing the two-hostname literal that was the structural
#      reason .101/.105 could not be used (they were absent by a literal `||`,
#      not by policy).
#   2. SLOT-AWARE placement. Measured 2026-08-30T05:0xZ: .201 read load1
#      14.08/32 = 0.44x -- the FITTEST ratio in the lab -- while running three
#      concurrent prepush suites behind a 10-deep queue. load1 is a CPU-time
#      proxy; the scarce resource is an exclusive heavy-suite slot, so a host
#      with a held slot is UNFIT (rc 3), not merely low-ranked.
#   3. A real remote EXECUTION leg (bundle transplant + identical argv +
#      completion-marker readback), where before the hook only ever probed the
#      other host and interpolated the answer into a refusal string.
#
# NON-NEGOTIABLES, all preserved here:
#   * Nothing in this file can make the gate accept LESS work. Every path
#     either produces a real green suite run on a designated host, or returns
#     "no evidence" and lets the caller fall through to the pre-existing
#     precedence (GitHub-hosted verify -> grant -> die).
#   * A remote RED is a REFUSAL, never a fall-through to the override grant.
#   * Unreachable / unreadable / below-floor / busy all mean SKIP, never
#     "assumed fit" -- the same fail-closed posture as the load probe.
#   * bash 3.2 compatible (macOS system bash): no associative arrays, no
#     `${var,,}`, no `{fd}` redirection, guarded empty-array expansion.

#
# The probe counts live prepush_smart_tests.sh processes because that is the

#
# SLOT-AWARE (OMN-17269): a row with `slots=N` gets N independently lockable
# candidates -- slot 1 at the pre-existing bare `<workroot>/LOCK` (unchanged
# path, so every slots=1 row is byte-identical to before) and slot k>=2 at
# `<workroot>/LOCK.<k>`. `held` is the COUNT of currently-held lock dirs across
# EVERY slot on the row, read fresh on each probe. The generalized busy check
# is `heavy_pids <= self + held`: on a slots=1 row `held` degenerates to `l`
# itself, reproducing the pre-OMN-17269 `p <= self` check exactly. On a
# multi-slot row it lets a legitimately-held OTHER slot explain its own
# process without flagging an untracked foreign process as fit -- if more
# heavy pids are running than held locks explain, that is an untracked
# process this table cannot account for, and the probe stays fail-closed.

# Orphaned spin-loop reaper (OMN-16995) -- runs BEFORE load is measured
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# omnibase_infra's own suite leaked one `sh -c while :; do :; done` per run:
# `tests/unit/scripts/test_heavy_lock.py` killed the heavy_lock WRAPPER and not
# the shell it wrapped, so the shell was reparented to PID 1 and burned a full
# core forever. Measured on `.200` 2026-08-30: 19 such orphans, every one
# PPID 1, aged 2h47m-12h17m, ~18.6 of 24 cores -- load1 39.31/24 = 1.64x
# against this gate's 1.0x threshold, so EVERY heavy escalation refused. After
# reaping them load1 fell to 17.06 (0.71x) in under 90s and the same escalation
# ran green. `.201` showed the same shape (11 orphans, 14.87 -> 5.95).
#
# The root cause is fixed in the test. This is the STOPGAP that keeps gate
# hosts usable while that fix propagates to every clone and every host, and
# the standing defense against the next process that leaks the same shape:
# load1 is read as a host-fitness FACT by lanes several tickets away from
# whatever produced the load, and no lane can diagnose it from where it stands.
#
# It is deliberately the narrowest possible matcher. All three conditions must
# hold, and a process that fails any one of them is untouched:
#   1. argv is EXACTLY `sh -c while :; do :; done` -- the no-op spin signature.
#      Not a prefix, not a substring, not `bash -c`, not a loop with a body.
#   2. PPID is exactly 1 -- already orphaned, so it has no supervisor that
#      could be waiting on it. (A container-reparented orphan, the `.201`
#      shape, has a non-1 PPID and is deliberately OUT of scope: reaping under
#      a live init we did not start is a bigger claim than this stopgap makes.)
#   3. Age >= PREPUSH_SPIN_ORPHAN_MIN_AGE seconds (default 600) -- long past
#      any plausible in-flight run of the test that spawns it.
# Every kill is logged with pid and age. A reap that cannot run for any reason
# is silent and non-fatal: this must never be able to refuse a push.

# REQUIRE_MODE defaults to `authorizing` and is the mode a row must carry to be

# finding 3: ranking on load alone let a `shadow` row outrank both authorizing
# hosts (h200=0.90 h201=0.30 h105=0.20(shadow) -> PICK=h105), and a shadow host
# by definition cannot satisfy the escalation, so the run was dispatched,
# executed, and then discarded -- an escalation that .200 or .201 could have
# answered got refused instead, minutes later. A non-eligible row is now
# skipped BEFORE it is probed: it can never win, so probing it only spends ssh
# round trips on the pre-push critical path.

# Tree transport -- the bundle MUST carry the TAG STATE (OMN-17240)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This leg used to build its transplant with `git bundle create "$bundle" HEAD`,
# which packs only the commits reachable from HEAD and NO ref under refs/tags/.
# Every remote clone, on every host, on every push, therefore had ZERO tags --
# and scripts/check_release_identity.py derives "the latest published version"
# from `git tag --list`. With no tags it silently took its "no published tag
# yet" branch, so three tests that assert the version-ahead message went red on
# the remote host while passing locally at the identical SHA (first seen on h101
# at OMN-17139's 47d7da183: 3 failed / 25618 passed remotely, 9 passed in 16.65s
# locally).
#
# Appending `--tags` alone is NOT the fix, and on a SHALLOW source it is worse
# than the defect. Measured on the canonical omnibase_infra clone before this
# change (97 tags, 576-commit graft): `git bundle create f HEAD --tags` exits 0
# and writes a bundle whose header lists all 97 tag refs, but cloning it dies --
#   error: Could not read 52222775d8563c036b7f9e15737573c95aa2ce18
#   fatal: remote did not send all necessary objects
# -- because the tags' ancestry lies beyond the graft. That converts a false red
# into a hard transport failure on every push, after paying the transfer.
#
# So the transport proves each step instead of assuming it: the source must be
# able to bundle tag ancestry at all (unshallow once when it cannot -- additive,
# ~8 s, and it is the object store the worktrees share), the bundle is written
# with HEAD *and* the tags, and the WRITTEN bundle is then read back and proven
# to carry tag refs before it is shipped. Anything unprovable returns 1 -- "no
# evidence" -- which sends the caller back to its existing precedence. No path
# here can make the gate accept less work, and none of the tag state comes from
# a caller-written file or env var: it is read from git refs the remote leg
# re-derives for itself after the clone.
#
# Wire cost, measured on omnibase_infra 2026-08-30:
#   shallow HEAD-only  (the broken transport)  18,599,149 B
#   unshallowed HEAD-only                      33,657,408 B

# the process that is about to burn the host's cores, and released when that

# so one externally-SIGTERMed run cannot wedge the host forever. The holder pid
