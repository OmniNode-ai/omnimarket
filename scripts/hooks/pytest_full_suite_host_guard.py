"""Direct-invocation .200-default host guard for pytest (OMN-15977 Hole 1).

The OMN-15059 guard (``scripts/hooks/prepush_smart_tests.sh``) refuses/redirects
the heavy full-suite path when it runs -- but ONLY when pytest is launched via
that hook, i.e. via ``git push``. It hooks the push path, not pytest itself.

Build agents routinely run the full suite DIRECTLY as a "prove nothing else
broke" verification step:

    uv run pytest tests/ -q > .gate_logs/full_suite3.log

No pre-push hook fires for that invocation, so the ``.200``-default host-check
is never consulted. Observed 3x in one lane (full_suite1/2/3) on 2026-08-12,
and confirmed as a live coverage hole in OMN-15977.

This module is the SAME host-identity check the bash hook performs
(``guard_full_suite_host`` in ``prepush_smart_tests.sh``), reimplemented so it
can also fire for a bare/direct ``pytest`` invocation via
``pytest_configure`` -- registered from the repo-root ``conftest.py`` so it
is loaded for every collection, regardless of which testpath is targeted.

Design mirrors the bash guard's documented posture exactly (see
``prepush_smart_tests.sh`` OMN-15059 section):

  * ROUTING OPTIMIZATION, NOT a security control. If host identity cannot be
    determined, FAIL OPEN -- proceed locally rather than lock a developer out
    of their own repo on an ambiguous read.
  * CI runners are never gated -- this guard exists to keep a contended local
    Mac from being driven to a load spike by a runaway full suite; a
    short-lived, isolated CI runner is not that failure mode.
  * The escape hatch is the same one the bash hook uses -- one mechanism for
    both entry points, not two. As of OMN-16480 that mechanism is a single-use,
    repo+HEAD-scoped, TTL-bounded, receipted grant token
    (``scripts/hooks/prepush_override_grant.py``), NOT an environment variable.
    Any ``PREPUSH_ALLOW_*`` variable present in the environment is now a HARD
    REFUSAL here, exactly as it is in the bash hook: an env var is inherited by
    every descendant process, so honoring one let a single leak disarm the gate
    for a whole process tree and recursively spawn a second 44,064-test suite
    (~9h03m lost, friction report F-01/F-04). See that module's docstring.
  * Only fires on an UNNARROWED collection targeting the full-suite root (or
    an ancestor of it) -- a targeted/narrow run (a single test file, a
    ``-k``/``-m`` filter) always stays runnable locally. Gating every
    invocation would get this guard disabled within a week, which is worse
    than no guard (verbatim rationale carried over from the bash hook).

Kept import-light and dependency-free (only ``os``/``socket``/``pytest``) so it
is trivial to unit test the pure decision function directly, and so the guard
itself can never be the thing that breaks pytest startup.

    OMN-16991. This guard used to read `.201`'s identity straight off
    ``PREPUSH_201_GATE_RUNNER_HOSTNAME`` -- and the bash hook's
    ``scrub_prepush_override_env`` deliberately unsets every ``PREPUSH_*`` name
    before ``exec uv run pytest``, so on the `.201` host (whose real
    ``hostname -s`` is ``omninode-pc``, not the container's
    ``gate-runner-201``) the sanctioned override never reached THIS guard. The
    push passed the bash guard and was then refused by its own pytest child.
    That is why `omnibase_infra` full-suite escalations could not run on `.201`
    at all.

    The scrub is NOT the bug and is not weakened here -- an inheritable
    ``PREPUSH_*`` override crossing into the pytest tree is exactly what turned
    one sanctioned grant into a recursive 44,064-test launcher (OMN-16425 F-01,
    ~9h03m). The bug was sourcing host IDENTITY from an environment variable
    that must not cross a process boundary. Identity now comes from a committed
    file that needs no inheritance at all.

    Read from ``git show HEAD:`` rather than the working tree, and ignored
    outright if the working copy diverges, so an uncommitted row cannot
    self-designate this machine. An unreadable table falls back to the two
    code-embedded defaults -- the pre-OMN-16991 behavior exactly, so a checkout
    without the table is neither more nor less permissive than before.
