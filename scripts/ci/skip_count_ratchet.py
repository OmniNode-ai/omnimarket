"""OMN-18790 — per-suite skip-count baseline ratchet for omnimarket (epic OMN-18775).

VENDORED, BY HAND, from omnibase_infra/scripts/ci/skip_count_ratchet.py at squash
77ea8d01 (OMN-18776). There is no automated vendoring path in this estate: every
repo hand-maintains its own ``scripts/ci/`` copy of shared CI tooling, exactly as
``ci_summary_gate.py`` is per-repo with no vendor marker anywhere. This header
naming the origin IS the convention. Keep the logic byte-identical to the origin
and carry differences in ``config/skip_count_baseline.yaml``, which is where a
repo's own measurement belongs.

A skipped test reports nothing. A *set* of tests that skips on every run, for
months, reports nothing and nobody notices, because a green job name looks
identical whether the test ran or was collected and dropped.

Epic OMN-18775 measured this on 2026-09-18. Five per-repo skip counts were
byte-identical across three consecutive CI runs each (17/17/17, 42/42/42,
36/36/36, 26/26/26, 13/13/13). omnimarket's ``Tests (Split 1/20)`` was the
42/42/42 row. Perfect stability is the diagnostic: a count that never moves is a
fixed set of tests that never runs. The cost is already paid — 91 PostgreSQL-16
cutover cases were collected and skipped on every full-matrix run for 49 days
(omnibase_infra#2547 → OMN-18762) and no skip surface anywhere registered it.

This gate refuses the *growth* of that set.

Two comparison modes, because one number does not fit both shapes of CI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
``count``
    For a suite whose collected set is the same on every run. The observed
    count of unique skipped tests may not exceed ``max_skips``. This is the
    mode omnimarket's ``test`` matrix landed in: three consecutive full-width
    runs each reported exactly 259 unique skipped ids, and the three sets were
    byte-identical.

``nodeids``
    For a suite behind an impacted-test selector, where the collected set —
    and therefore the raw skip count — legitimately varies run to run
    (omnibase_infra measured 45, 95 and 547 unique skips on three consecutive
    runs of the same job). Comparing counts there produces false failures, so
    this mode compares the *identities*: every skipped test must already be in
    the baseline set.

Lowering a baseline is an edit to ``config/skip_count_baseline.yaml``, reviewed
like any other diff. There is deliberately no command-line and no environment
lever that lowers a verdict — see ``tests/ci/test_skip_count_ratchet_omn18790.py``,
which reads this parser's own option strings and this file's own source.

Honest limit: this counts skips, it does not judge them. A test skipped for a
good structural reason and one skipped because CI never set its env var look
identical to a counter. What the ratchet removes is the silent growth of the
set, not the set.

Usage
-----
    skip_count_ratchet.py --suite KEY --junit FILE [FILE ...] [--baseline FILE]
    skip_count_ratchet.py --suite KEY --junit FILE ... --print-observed
    skip_count_ratchet.py --selftest

``--print-observed`` renders the observed set as a baseline-shaped YAML block on
stdout for a human to paste into the baseline file. It reaches no verdict and
writes no file.

Exit codes: 0 = within baseline; 1 = the skip set grew; 2 = usage or input error
(fail-closed — an absent, unparsable or unregistered input is a failure, never a
pass).
