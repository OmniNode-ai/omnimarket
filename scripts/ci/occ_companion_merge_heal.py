"""Re-run a preflight that gave up before its companion merged (OMN-18812).

Why this module exists
----------------------
``occ-preflight / eligibility`` waits a bounded ``1500`` seconds for the cited
onex_change_control companion to merge and then fails closed
(``omnibase_core`` ``scripts/ci/occ_preflight_wait.py``, OMN-17864). That
budget was sized on a measured distribution, and the distribution moved.

Re-measured 2026-09-19 over the 1000 most recently merged evidence companions
(``search/issues``, ``repo:OmniNode-ai/onex_change_control is:pr is:merged
created:>=2026-09-12 in:title evidence``), open-to-merge: p50 27.6 min, p75
50.8 min, p90 125.7 min, p95 183.7 min. The live budget covers 46.3% of them.
The OMN-17864 docstring's own basis, measured three days earlier, was p50 16
min / p95 55 min and "covers 141/188 (75%)"; p95 moved 3.3x in three days.

There is no number that fixes this. The job declares ``timeout-minutes: 30``,
so every admissible budget sits below p75, and a constant re-cut by hand
cannot track a distribution that moves faster than the re-cut.

The failure is also replicated rather than singular. 56 omniclaude workflows
each instantiate the preflight reusable as their own ``occ-preflight`` job and
gate a real check on ``needs: occ-preflight``. On ``omniclaude#2265``, head
``d75e0606``, that produced 42 ``occ-preflight / eligibility`` check runs on
one sha, 8 failure and 34 success, 29,107 seconds of summed wall clock, and 24
workflow runs that a human then re-ran by hand. Every failure started at
11:07:30Z or 11:08:06Z; the first-wave successes started at 11:07:30Z or
11:08:21Z. A 36-second difference in when the fleet picked the job up decided
the verdict on an identical fact.

What this does instead
----------------------
Nothing here changes the budget, and nothing here changes WHAT is required.
This module answers one question per open PR — *has the companion this PR is
blocked on merged since the preflight gave up?* — and, when the answer is yes,
re-runs the failed jobs of that PR's failed runs in place.

``gh run rerun --failed`` preserves the run id, so ``CI Summary`` re-polls the
same job list it always polls and observes the new verdict, and every job that
already passed keeps its result. The re-run executes the eligibility validator
from scratch against the merged companion SHA and can still fail. What is
removed is the human who types the command: all three of the 2026-09-19
occurrences were cleared that way and by nothing else.

Why a schedule, and not the companion's merge event
---------------------------------------------------
The event that makes the fact true is the companion merging, which happens in
``onex_change_control``. Dispatching from there into a product repo needs
``actions: write`` on the product repo, and no identity this org holds has it:
read live and recorded in OMN-18797, installation 148180820
(``onexbot-occ-writer``) holds ``actions: read``, installation 123040063
(``onexbot``) holds ``actions: read``, and the org PAT's uses inside that
workflow are ratcheted by OMN-16373. The remaining invocation point that needs
no new credential is a schedule inside the product repo, where the ambient
``GITHUB_TOKEN`` already carries ``actions: write``.

The in-repo events were each considered and each fires at the wrong moment.
``pull_request: edited`` fires when the autobind stamp lands, about a minute
after the push. ``workflow_run: completed`` on a preflight caller fires when
the wait deadlines. Both precede the median companion merge by tens of
minutes, which is exactly why ``omnibase_infra``'s OMN-18352 heal — which
listens to precisely those two — does not clear this failure.

Shape
-----
Mirrors ``omnibase_infra`` ``scripts/ci/occ_preflight_heal.py``: a pure
``decide_companion_heal`` verdict function, a :class:`GhPort` protocol for the
live reads and the one write, a :class:`GhCli` implementation backed by the
``gh`` binary, and a thin ``main()`` driver. The pure function is exhaustively
unit-tested; the client is exercised by the workflow itself.

Every branch that does not re-run says which branch it was. The defect that
produced ``omnibase_infra``'s heal was a green job that had healed nothing
behind a single "nothing to do" message covering both "there was nothing to
heal" and "I could not tell"; each refusal here carries its own
:class:`EnumCompanionHealOutcome`, and a PR whose state cannot be read at all
is reported and exits non-zero rather than passing as a clean no-op.

Cost and bounds
---------------
A re-run is issued only when the companion is already MERGED, so the re-run
this module spends is one the wait will satisfy on its first poll rather than
a second 1500-second budget against a fact that is still false. That is the
whole reason the companion state is read before the re-run and not after.

``MAX_HEAL_RUN_ATTEMPT`` is a hard backstop against an unforeseen loop: a run
already at the ceiling is refused whatever its state. The merged-companion
precondition is expected to do the actual work, because a healed run's
preflight passes and stops appearing in the failed set at all.
