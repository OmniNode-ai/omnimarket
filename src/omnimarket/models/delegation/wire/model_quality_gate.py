#     combined (JUDGE_FAILED: judge unreachable / throttled, or no judge run).
#   SCORE_SOURCE_COMBINED — the LLM-judge adequacy score WAS combined into the
#     graded score (judge reachable).
#
# The distinction is load-bearing for OMN-13959: when the judge is unavailable a
# verifiable class can only ever produce SCORE_SOURCE_DETERMINISTIC_ACCEPTANCE,
# and the combined-score ``required_bar`` (0.85) is structurally un-meetable
# without the judge band — so acceptance must fall back to the deterministic
# floor verdict instead of failing valid local output during a cloud-judge outage.
