"""Regression guard for the pre-push hook's `.200`-default host-identity
guard (OMN-15059).

Root cause this prevents regressing: root CLAUDE.md documents that the heavy
(full-suite, fail-closed escalation) branch of the pre-push hook defaults to
running on the `.200` execution host, not the local Mac -- but a rule stated
only in a doc/prompt has zero enforcement force without a call-site mechanism
(memory `feedback_a_rule_is_not_a_mechanism`). Evidence this was load-bearing:
a 2026-07-24 session drove the local Mac to load ~55 with 93% swap running
this exact escalation for 115+ minutes before `.200` was invoked as a rescue
rather than having been the execution target from the start.

Three assertion classes:

1. Static wiring -- `guard_full_suite_host` is defined and is the first
   statement inside EVERY `IS_FULL` (full-suite) branch, so a future edit
   cannot silently drop the call site while leaving the branch intact.
2. Behavioral -- actually invoking the hook with the full-suite escalation
   forced (`PREPUSH_FULL_SUITE=1`) and a guaranteed-non-matching
   `PREPUSH_200_HOSTNAME` override exits non-zero WITHOUT ever reaching the
   real pytest invocation. The override makes this host-independent: it must
   hold true no matter which host runs the test suite (including `.200`
   itself), so the test does not rely on the ambient hostname.
3. Heavyweight-SELECTION (OMN-15408) -- the guard must key on the work the
   selector actually picked, not on the `is_full_suite` flag. The selector
   routinely emits `is_full_suite=False` with `selected_paths=["tests/"]`, and
   before OMN-15408 those runs bypassed the guard outright: 13,898 tests /
   506s in omnimarket and 2,429 tests / 245s in omnibase_infra, executed on
   `omnibook` through real `git push` runs on 2026-07-29 with the guard never
   invoked -- while the identical selected work forced via
   `PREPUSH_FULL_SUITE=1` WAS refused. Assertion classes 1 and 2 above were
   green that entire time, because both only ever drove the flag-true path.

# it fired on the selector's `is_full_suite` FLAG. The selector routinely emits
# `is_full_suite=False` with `selected_paths=["tests/"]` -- the whole suite
# arriving as an "impacted subset" -- and those runs bypassed the guard
# entirely. Measured on host `omnibook` through real `git push` runs on
# 2026-07-29: omnimarket ran 13,898 tests in 506s and omnibase_infra 2,429 tests
# in 245s, locally, with the guard never invoked; the SAME selected work forced
# via `PREPUSH_FULL_SUITE=1` was refused. Identical cost, opposite outcome,
# decided by a flag. The tests below drive the flag-FALSE path, which is the one
# that reaches production behavior -- the pre-existing tests in this file only
# ever exercised the flag-TRUE path, and were green while the hole was open.
