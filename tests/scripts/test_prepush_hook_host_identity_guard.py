"""Regression guard for the pre-push hook's `.200`-default host-identity
guard (OMN-15059).

Root cause this prevents regressing: root CLAUDE.md documents that the heavy
(full-suite, fail-closed escalation) branch of the pre-push hook defaults to
running on the `.200` execution host, not the local Mac -- but a rule stated
only in a doc/prompt has zero enforcement force without a call-site mechanism
(memory `feedback_a_rule_is_not_a_mechanism`). Evidence this was load-bearing:
a 2026-07-24 session drove the local Mac to load ~55 with 93% swap running
this exact escalation for 115+ minutes before `.200` was invoked as a rescue
rather than having been the execution target from the start.

Two assertion classes:

1. Static wiring -- `guard_full_suite_host` is defined and is the first
   statement inside EVERY `IS_FULL` (full-suite) branch, so a future edit
   cannot silently drop the call site while leaving the branch intact.
2. Behavioral -- actually invoking the hook with the full-suite escalation
   forced (`PREPUSH_FULL_SUITE=1`) and a guaranteed-non-matching
   `PREPUSH_200_HOSTNAME` override exits non-zero WITHOUT ever reaching the
   real pytest invocation. The override makes this host-independent: it must
   hold true no matter which host runs the test suite (including `.200`
   itself), so the test does not rely on the ambient hostname.
