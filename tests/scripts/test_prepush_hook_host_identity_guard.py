"""Regression guard for the pre-push hook's `.200`-default host-identity
guard (OMN-15059).

Root cause this prevents regressing: root CLAUDE.md documents that the heavy
(full-suite, fail-closed escalation) branch of the pre-push hook defaults to
running on the `.200` execution host, not the local Mac -- but a rule stated
only in a doc/prompt has zero enforcement force without a call-site mechanism
(memory `feedback_a_rule_is_not_a_mechanism`). Evidence this was load-bearing:
a 2026-07-24 session drove the local Mac to load ~55 with 93% swap running
this exact escalation for 115+ minutes before `.200` was invoked as a rescue
rather than having been the execution target from the start.

Three assertion classes:

1. Static wiring -- `guard_full_suite_host` is defined and is the first
   statement inside EVERY `IS_FULL` (full-suite) branch, so a future edit
   cannot silently drop the call site while leaving the branch intact.
2. Behavioral -- actually invoking the hook with the full-suite escalation
   forced (`PREPUSH_FULL_SUITE=1`) and a guaranteed-non-matching
   `PREPUSH_200_HOSTNAME` override exits non-zero WITHOUT ever reaching the
   real pytest invocation. The override makes this host-independent: it must
   hold true no matter which host runs the test suite (including `.200`
   itself), so the test does not rely on the ambient hostname.
3. Heavyweight-SELECTION (OMN-15408) -- the guard must key on the work the
   selector actually picked, not on the `is_full_suite` flag. The selector
   routinely emits `is_full_suite=False` with `selected_paths=["tests/"]`, and
   before OMN-15408 those runs bypassed the guard outright: 13,898 tests /
   506s in omnimarket and 2,429 tests / 245s in omnibase_infra, executed on
   `omnibook` through real `git push` runs on 2026-07-29 with the guard never
   invoked -- while the identical selected work forced via
   `PREPUSH_FULL_SUITE=1` WAS refused. Assertion classes 1 and 2 above were
   green that entire time, because both only ever drove the flag-true path.

    The guard admits a host if `hostname -s` matches EITHER designated
    identity: `.200` (``PREPUSH_200_HOSTNAME``) or the `.201` gate-runner
    container (``PREPUSH_201_GATE_RUNNER_HOSTNAME``, default
    ``gate-runner-201``). Every "the guard must REFUSE" proof below therefore
    has to neutralise both; overriding only the `.200` name leaves the `.201`
    arm live, and on a host whose real hostname matches it the guard correctly
    ALLOWS and the assertion inverts.

    That is not hypothetical, and the cost was not a cosmetic red. The `.201`
    gate-runner is the host the OMN-16295 capacity guard routes to when `.200`
    is over threshold — i.e. the one host where the full suite is MOST likely
    to run — and its container sets ``hostname: gate-runner-201`` precisely so
    the guard recognises it. Running this file there on 2026-08-27 turned
    ``test_guard_refuses_full_suite_escalation_on_non_200_host`` (which drives
    the REAL hook, with no stubbed pytest) from a refusal proof into a live
    RECURSIVE FULL-SUITE FORK BOMB: the guard allowed, the hook ran the whole
    suite, that suite re-reached this test, popped the recursion sentinel
    (documented below as deliberate first-entry behavior) and re-entered —
    measured four nested full suites deep, one new level per minute, on the
    shared `.201` host that also carries the runner fleet and every runtime
    lane.

    So this override is a correctness AND a containment requirement. Neutralise
    both identities; do not narrow this to one.
