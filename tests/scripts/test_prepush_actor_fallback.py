"""The governed pre-push dispatcher must work for an actor who is not the lab's
owner (OMN-17280).

THE DEFECT, reproduced live 2026-09-01 before any of this was written. Every
``ssh_target`` in ``scripts/hooks/prepush_hosts.tsv`` hardcoded one operator's
login, so for any other actor every remote row answered
``Permission denied (publickey,password)`` -- measured against all four lab
rows with a non-owner login, every one rc=255 in under a second. The actor's
OWN host still probed ``fit``, but ``dispatch_to_lab_host`` skips a self
candidate (it carries no ssh target), so the ranked walk executed nothing and
the refusal ladder fell through to ``die()``::

    PROBE_LOG=h200=slot-unknown h201=fit(0.10,authorizing,40000MiB,tier=last_resort)
    WALK idx=1 label=h201 -> SKIPPED (self candidate, no ssh target)
    CANDIDATE_COUNT=1  REMOTE_LEG_EXECUTED=0

A second, independent defect fed the same refusal: ``prepush_lock_acquire``
reported EACCES on a workroot the actor cannot write as rc=1 (CONTENDED), so
the caller printed "this host is fit but its heavy-suite slot is already held"
-- measurably false, and the exact shape every non-owner hits on every push.

What is pinned here:

1. No capacity row may hardcode an ssh login, and the picker must parse a row
   whose ``ssh_target`` carries no user field.
2. Reachability is measured for THIS actor, not assumed from the table.
3. The same-host route fires only when NO capacity row is reachable, so one
   reachable lab host keeps the OMN-17392 / OMN-17485 off-box preference
   exactly as it shipped.
4. It refuses itself on identity (a host absent from the table) and on genuine
   slot contention (OMN-16174 serialization wins).
5. It writes a receipt naming the reason, so a same-host run is auditable
   rather than believed.
6. It sits ABOVE the override grant in the ladder -- it produces a real full
   suite on a designated host, which is stronger evidence than a grant, and it
   burns no grant to get there.

The bash is extract-and-executed, the pattern this hook's other shell tests
already use, so the assertions run THE code that ships.
