"""S0 tactical defect patch for the pre-push hook (OMN-16489).

Three defects, each proven live in the 2026-08-23/24 window
(`docs/tracking/2026-08-24-system-friction-report.md` F-01/F-04, plan
`docs/plans/2026-08-24-blocker-decoupling-redesign-plan.md` §4 S0 items 1-3):

1. NO recursion guard — this hook spawns pytest, and the spawned suite
   contains tests that exec this same hook script. A re-entering child can
   launch nested full suites: the OMN-16425 class cost ~9h03m across 5 failed
   ~1h45m runs. OMN-16425's fix scrubbed the *test sites*; the hook itself
   still accepted re-entry. Fix: an exported `ONEX_PREPUSH_HOOK_ACTIVE=<pid>`
   sentinel; a nested invocation refuses fail-closed before any selector or
   pytest work.

2. Override env vars inherit downward — the hook handed its FULL environment
   (including `PREPUSH_ALLOW_LOCAL_FULL_SUITE` and every `PREPUSH_*` override)
   to the pytest subprocess tree, so a bypass granted to the outer push was
   silently honored by every descendant (F-04: "permission to bypass once"
   became "permission for every descendant process, forever"). Fix: the hook
   strips exported `PREPUSH_*` (+`ENABLE_SMART_TESTS`) from the spawned
   pytest env. Entry semantics are deliberately UNCHANGED — the override
   redesign is OMN-16480, review-gated.

3. Empty-hostname fail-open — `guard_full_suite_host()` warned and
   `return 0`ed when `hostname -s` produced nothing, so the heavy escalation
   proceeded on a host that could not be identified, contradicting the hook's
   own fail-loud doctrine ("a gate that cannot run must be indistinguishable
   from a failing gate"). Fix: fail CLOSED with a remediation message.

All behavioral tests below run THE real hook script end-to-end with the same
stubbed-`uv` harness `tests/scripts/test_prepush_hook_host_identity_guard.py`
established for OMN-15408, never a Python re-implementation of it.
