"""OMN-16647: the omnimarket copy hosts the cross-repo runner-route shim.

A caller outside omnibase_infra asks this reusable workflow where its jobs
should run. The answer comes from an ONEX COMPUTE node in omnibase_infra whose
contract declares the thresholds, the label sets and the private-repository
refusal. This file is the mechanical guard on the word SHIM: the moment a
threshold, a label set or a second copy of the decision appears here, there are
two routing policies that agree until somebody edits one of them.

THREE FAILURES PINNED HERE ARE INVISIBLE TO EVERY CHECK-BASED GATE, which is
why they are tests rather than review items:

* An expression in a ``workflow_call`` description fails every CALLING workflow
  at startup -- zero jobs, no red check, and a run title that falls back to the
  file path (omnibase_infra run 35037012235).
* A route job without its environment raises ModuleNotFoundError, falls through
  the fail-closed floor, and reports SUCCESS carrying
  ``reason=probe_error:module_unavailable`` while placing everything hosted
  (omnibase_infra run 35039101488).
* A floor that runs AFTER the refusal check would overwrite a deliberate
  refusal with hosted labels, which is the one placement the ruling forbids.
